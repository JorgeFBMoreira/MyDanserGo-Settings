## What is this repository for?
I made this repository to have a "online backup" of my danser settings. I'll leave a little list here of what you may need to change if you want to use my settings.

### Graphics
```json
"General": {
	"OsuSongsDir": "C:\\Users\\Leonardo\\AppData\\Local\\osu!\\Songs",
	"OsuSkinsDir": "C:\\Users\\Leonardo\\AppData\\Local\\osu!\\Skins",
	"DiscordPresenceOn": true,
	"UnpackOszFiles": true
},
```
"OsuSongsDir" | "OsuSkinsDir": Change "\\Username\\" to your account name. For example, if you use Windows 10 and your account name is "Leonardo", change "Username" to "Leonardo".\n
"DiscordPresenceOn": is a option to link to your discord as a "discord rich". In summary, if you use danser, it'll be displayed in your Discord Account.\n
"UnpackOszFiles": I suggest to leave this option on.
